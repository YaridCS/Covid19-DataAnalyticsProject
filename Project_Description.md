# Covid19-DataAnalyticsProject
A personal project by me utilizing my Computational Data Analytics and Analysis skills in the field of Computer Science. 

The goal is to increase public awareness and education regarding the state of Covid-19 around the world, which anti-Covid practices and measures are effective, the ones that are not, etc. 

All the data and information in this project is data that has been realeased to the public by official governmental organizations, hospitals, etc. 

The data released is often very large and messy sets of information which can often be difficult to comprehend for the general public and even what 
that data ultimately means or is trying to say.

This project collects all of the publicly released Covid-19 data (which us continously being updated all the time) and analyzes it in a way the general public can understand and become educated regarding the state of Covid-19 around the world.
